## Description

EID-112 is a localized temporal anomaly occurring in a 5-meter radius area near Pier 7 of Innsmouth Harbor. The anomaly manifests as follows:

1. Objects entering the zone experience time dilation effects
2. Sounds from the past (dated between 1920-1928) can be heard within the zone
3. Photographs taken within the zone sometimes show images from approximately 100 years in the past
4. Electronic equipment exhibits unpredictable behavior

## Investigation History

- **November 23, 1994:** Fishermen reported "hearing voices from another time"
- **November 25, 1994:** Eidolon Capital deployed investigation team
- **December 1, 1994:** Temporal nature of anomaly confirmed through radiometric testing
- **January 15, 1995:** Containment field established
- **February 2, 1995:** Upgraded to Class-A following unexpected temporal surge

## Current Status

The anomaly is contained within a specialized temporal dampening field. The area has been designated as a restricted zone and is under 24/7 surveillance. Research access is granted on a case-by-case basis.

## Safety Protocols

- No unauthorized entry permitted
- Maximum exposure time: 5 minutes for Level 4+ personnel
- All equipment must be pre-approved by Dr. Harrow
- Temporal monitoring devices must be worn at all times
- Emergency extraction procedures must be reviewed before entry

## Research Notes

Dr. Harrow's team has documented over 200 distinct audio recordings from the 1920s era. Analysis suggests a possible connection to historical events at the harbor. The temporal echo appears strongest during fog conditions.

## Warning

DO NOT attempt to introduce objects from the 1920s into the anomaly zone. Previous experiments resulted in unexpected resonance effects.
