# Overview

The Vatican Office of Sacred Anomalies (VOSA) is a secretive wing of the Catholic Church that attempts to retrieve and contain anomalies. They deem these anomalies “sacred relics” and seek to preserve them from outside misuse. 

The relics are believed to be kept in a secret storehouse. The location is so far unknown.
